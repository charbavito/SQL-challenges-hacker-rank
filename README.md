## <strong>The Challenge</strong>
This is a series of 57 SQL Challenges, covering the main aspects of the SQL language such as Queries, Filters, Functions, Aggregations, etc.

## <strong>Important</strong>
<div>
The database is made available by the platform itself, that is, we do not have access to the Download Bank, only for queries, however, all the information necessary to interpret and resolve the challenges is provided in the statement. For my resolutions, I used SQL commands based on SGDB MySQL.
